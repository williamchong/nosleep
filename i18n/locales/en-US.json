        "answer": "NoSleep uses your browser's built-in Screen Wake Lock API - a safe, standard technology that prevents your screen from sleeping. Simply click the button to activate, and optionally set a timer (1-480 minutes) to automatically release when done. The animated sun/moon icons show the current status. For best results, use the floating window feature which creates an always-on-top popup that stays visible even when you switch tabs."

        "question": "Is it safe to use?",
        "answer": "Yes, completely safe! This tool only uses standard web APIs and doesn't access your files, camera, microphone, or any personal data. It simply prevents your device from sleeping - the same as moving your mouse occasionally. No data is collected or transmitted."
