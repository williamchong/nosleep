      "howItWorks": {
        "question": "How does NoSleep work?",
        "answer": "NoSleep uses your browser's built-in Screen Wake Lock API - a safe, standard technology that prevents your screen from sleeping. Simply click the button to activate, and optionally set a timer (1-480 minutes) to automatically release when done. The animated sun/moon icons show the current status. For best results, use the floating window feature which creates an always-on-top popup that stays visible even when you switch tabs."
      },
      "safety": {
        "question": "Is it safe to use?",
        "answer": "Yes, completely safe! This tool only uses standard web APIs and doesn't access your files, camera, microphone, or any personal data. It simply prevents your device from sleeping - the same as moving your mouse occasionally. No data is collected or transmitted."

This floating window automatically syncs with the main page and won't accidentally get hidden when you switch tabs. Alternatively, you can keep the main tab active and visible, but the floating window is recommended for reliability and convenience."
