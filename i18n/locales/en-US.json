      "howItWorks": {
        "question": "How does it work?",
        "answer": "This website uses the modern Screen Wake Lock API built into your browser. For unsupported browsers, it provides a video-based fallback method that requires user interaction to activate. The auto-sleep timer lets you set custom durations (1-480 minutes) for automatic wake lock release. Visual animations indicate when your device is being kept awake."

        "question": "Is it safe to use?",
        "answer": "Yes, completely safe! This tool only uses standard web APIs and doesn't access your files, camera, microphone, or any personal data. It simply prevents your device from sleeping - the same as moving your mouse occasionally. No data is collected or transmitted."
