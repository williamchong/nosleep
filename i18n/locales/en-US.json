        "question": "How does it work?",
        "answer": "This website uses your browser's built-in screen wake feature when available. For older browsers, it uses a backup method that needs you to click first. You can set timers from 1-480 minutes to automatically let your device sleep again. The animated icons show when it's actively keeping your screen awake. Use the dedicated popup window to prevent accidentally closing the tab."

      "safety": {
        "question": "Is it safe to use?",
        "answer": "Yes, completely safe! This tool only uses standard web APIs and doesn't access your files, camera, microphone, or any personal data. It simply prevents your device from sleeping - the same as moving your mouse occasionally. No data is collected or transmitted."

        "answer": "Click \"Timer\" to set how long you want your screen to stay awake (1-480 minutes). Type a number or use the quick buttons (+1, +5, +10, +30 minutes). Your device will automatically go back to normal sleep mode when time runs out - perfect for downloads, work sessions, or study time. Cancel anytime if you need to stop early."

The popup window syncs with this main page and is less likely to accidentally get hidden. If you see an amber/yellow button, click it first to activate. Switching tabs or minimizing will stop the wake lock."
