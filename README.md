## 🚀 How It Works

NoSleep uses your browser's built-in [Screen Wake Lock API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Screen_Wake_Lock_API) - a safe, standard web technology that prevents your screen from sleeping. It's like moving your mouse occasionally, but automatic and hands-free.

### Simple 3-Step Process
1. **Click the button** to activate wake lock
2. **Set a timer** (optional) - choose 1-480 minutes or run until you manually stop
3. **Keep the tab active** or use the floating window feature

### Smart Features
- **Instant Activation**: One click starts keeping your screen awake
- **Animated Status Icons**: Sun animation when active, moon when sleeping
- **Flexible Timers**: Preset durations (15 min, 1 hour, 4 hours) or custom slider (1-480 min)
- **Floating Window**: Dedicated popup that stays on top and syncs with main page
- **Auto-Release**: Automatically allows sleep when timer expires
- **Cross-Window Sync**: Controls in floating window update the main page in real-time

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

### ✅ Supported Browsers (Wake Lock API Required)
- **Chrome/Chromium 84+** (Windows, Mac, Linux, Android)
- **Microsoft Edge 84+** (Windows, Mac)
- **Safari 16.4+** (Mac, iPhone, iPad)
- **Firefox** (with additional configuration)

### ❌ Unsupported Browsers
Browsers without Screen Wake Lock API will see a clear error message with upgrade instructions.

**Note**: The app automatically detects your browser's capabilities. For the best experience, use the floating window feature on supported browsers.

## 📖 How to Use

### Quick Start (No Timer)
1. **Visit** the website at [nosleep.williamchong.cloud](https://nosleep.williamchong.cloud)
2. **Click** the main button - it will turn from red to green
3. **Notice** the sun animation - your screen is now staying awake
4. **Click again** when done to allow normal sleep

### Using the Timer Feature
1. **Click "Set Timer"** below the main button
2. **Choose your duration**:
   - Select a preset: 15 minutes, 1 hour, or 4 hours
   - Or choose "Custom" and use the slider (1-480 minutes)
3. **Click "Start Timer"** to begin
4. **Relax** - your screen stays awake until the timer expires
5. **Cancel anytime** if you finish early

### 🪟 Using the Floating Window (Recommended)
1. **Click "Open Floating Window"** button
2. **A small window appears** that stays on top of other windows
3. **Control from either window** - they stay in sync
4. **Switch tabs freely** - the floating window keeps working
5. **Close the floating window** when done - main page takes over

### 💡 Tips for Best Results
- **Use the floating window** to avoid accidentally closing the tab
- **Set realistic timers** to save battery (30-60 min for downloads)
- **The tab must stay open** but doesn't need to be visible if using floating window
- **Battery impact**: Keeping screen awake uses more power - use timers wisely

### 🎨 What the Icons Mean
- **☀️ Sun with rays**: Your screen is staying awake
- **🌙 Moon**: Your screen can sleep normally
- **Timer countdown**: Shows remaining time (e.g., "23:45 remaining")

## 🔒 Privacy & Safety

**100% Safe to Use**
- ✅ No installation or downloads required
- ✅ No access to your files, camera, or microphone
- ✅ No data collection or tracking (beyond anonymous analytics)
- ✅ No account creation needed
- ✅ Uses only standard web browser APIs
- ✅ Open source - you can review the code

**How It's Safe**: This tool only uses your browser's built-in Screen Wake Lock API - the same technology that video players use to keep your screen on during playback. It's as safe as watching a YouTube video.

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Will this drain my battery?**
A: Keeping your screen awake uses more power than letting it sleep. Use timers to minimize battery impact - set them only as long as you need.

**Q: What happens if I close the tab?**
A: The wake lock stops immediately. Use the floating window feature to prevent accidentally closing it.

**Q: Can I use this on my phone?**
A: Yes! It works on iPhone (Safari 16.4+) and Android (Chrome 84+). The floating window may not be available on all mobile browsers.

**Q: Is this better than changing my system settings?**
A: Yes! It's temporary and automatic. No need to remember to change settings back. When you close the tab or timer expires, everything returns to normal.

**Q: Does this work offline?**
A: No, you need an internet connection to load the page initially. Once loaded, it works without continuous internet connection.
